Nine field notebooks dating to 1970, 1971, and 1973 might be of particular interest. As well as linguistic information, Crawford also kept track of his itinerary, possible language consultants, etc. Crawford's interest in the Mobilian trade language is clear from the start, as he mentions Arzelia Langley and other consultants early on in #1 before focusing on Yuchi. Interviews with Maggie Poncho and Leonard Lavan are at the end of #4 after Crawford spent most of the summer working with Yuchi consultants, and his pursuit of Mobilian resumed in the summer of 1971 with #5, when Lavan was dying and no longer recognized Crawford, but Crawford worked with members of the Langley and Medford families and continued searching for more Mobilian speakers before again spending most of the summer working with Yuchi consultants in Sapulpa, Oklahoma. In the summer of 1973, Crawford worked on Yuchi in Sapulpa again before heading to Arizona and spending the rest of the summer working on Cocopa, particularly Cocopa baby talk. Language consultants mentioned include Frank Seymour, Nancy Wildcat, Addie George, Maggie Poncho, Leonard Lavan, Claude Medford, and many more potential consultants mentioned. A tenth notebook, dated to 1987 and largely empty, records another brief trip to Sapulpa to work again with Addie George and other Yuchi consultants. These notebooks, as well as a folder labeled “Notes” that is filled with miscellaneous handwritten and typed notes relating to Crawford's research trips, work on the Yuchi language, work with Yuchi people on bilingual education, and the like, all mention numerous Yuchi and other indigenous individuals and sometimes include genealogical and family history information as well. Finally, there are 45 boxes of word slips, Yuchi—English and English—Yuchi, in Series V. Card Files, and four magnetic tapes of Yuchi linguistic materials dating from 1979 to 1986 in Series IV-B, Research Notes &amp;amp; Notebooks—Yuchi (an Oversized series).

Subject Files. Finally, Series I. Correspondence contains correspondence from Raymond Fogelson with reader reports from William Sturtevant and Lew Ballard on Crawford's Yuchi entry for the Handbook of North American Indians, and Crawford's reply asking that the entry be reassigned due the years that have passed since he submitted the essay and the considerable edits required to revise the entry for and correspondence from William Sturtevant regarding attempts by Kristian Hvidt (librarian of the Danish parliament) to learn more about 1735 Georgia drawings by Baron Philipp Georg von Reck, a commissaire to the Salzburgers who settled at Ebenezer, along with Crawford's subsequent notes and drafts of a brief essay on the history and nature of the images, stressing the Yuchi and Creek elements.",Collection,http://www.language-archives.org/item/oai:indigenousguide.amphilsoc.org:10450

Fifteen field notebooks in in Series IV-A. Research Notes and Notebooks—Cocopa might be of particular interest. Ranging in date from 1963-1979, Crawford's Cocopah notebooks are dense with linguistic data and texts – much of which he eventually published – but also provide the names, locations, and sometimes the personal and family histories of language consultants, information about his itinerary and experiences, and generally flesh out his research trips, experiences in the field, and relationships with indigenous consultants, particularly Victor Hayes and Lillian Hayes. Several notebooks also connect Crawford's tapes to specific notebooks. His notes indicate that he worked on the material in these notebooks well into the 1980s. Some Yuchi material in #13 and perhaps elsewhere. Maricopa and other Yuman language material also present. Other consultants mentioned include Mary (Johnson) Thomas (described as a “storyteller” willing to record stories), Walter Thomas, Charlie Huck, Frank Thomas, and Rudy Hayes. At the end of #15, Crawford records that Frank Thomas, Victor Hayes, and Rudy Hayes recorded 14 songs in his apartment one their way to sing at the funeral of a Maricopa infant: “All are ‘Mohave Songs' and bird songs.” Meter readings included. Four folders labeled “Notes” might also be of particular interest to some researchers. “Notes #1” contains a written account on loose page paper about a 1962 research trip, “Account of reconnaissance among several languages of the Yuman family in Arizona” (see typed report of same name and other related material in Yuman entry); handwritten notes about the reconnaissance trip; a pamphlet about Prescott, Arizona and Yavapai County, with some directions in pencil on a map of the town; some sheets about potential consultants like Viola Jimalla, Johnnie San Diego, Edward San Diego, Lorenzo Sinyella, Perry Sundust; handwritten Vocabularies, word slips, and other linguistic materials; and bibliographic materials. “Notes #2” contains a handwritten story, “Twins,” in English; miscellaneous linguistic notes, often in an unidentified language and only sometimes with English translation; and miscellaneous notes relating to Crawford's work at the University of Georgia. “Notes #3” includes work on a text or story (V-59); handwritten Vocabularies and other linguistic materials; sheets of linguistic data titled “for Lillian” or “for Victor” that perhaps indicate matters he hoped those consultants could resolve; some sheets relating to a sitting with Charlie Huck and Mary Thomas in 1963; and miscellaneous slips with bibliographic information, notes to self, etc. “Notes #4” contains notes related to a trip from Berkley to Arizona in November-December 1965, including mileage, maps copied from secondary works on Southwestern languages, lists of bibliographic references, etc. Other materials in Series IV-A.

The American Philosophical Society,"Newspaper clippings, Postcards, Brochures, Specimens, Stillimages, Text, PhysicalObject",9765,Arrow Head,"This collection of memorabilia includes clippings, postcards (one from Marion H. Dickson), a brochure, and an arrow-head (a gift from the site to Murphy D. Smith, who deposited these materials at the APS). Images from a 1945 article in the Peoria Morning Star on the establishment of the new historical state park at the site include several striking photos of an excavated burial site (described as containing 230 skeletons of Mound-builders who died in a devastating epidemic), including one with of a school group at the burial site and another highlighting Dr. Don F. Dickson's method of leaving the dead in situ; a photo of the Dickson family farmstead (on which the Dickson mounds were located) before the establishment of the state park; and a photo of reconstructed pottery displayed in the museum. There is also a brochure about the site as a tourist and educational attraction with information on the history of the mounts, the Dickson Mound Museum, the work of the Dickson family (primarily Dr. Don F. Dickson, Marion H. Dickson, and Thomas M. Dickson), and the neighboring Payne Collection of artifacts. Several images of the excavated mass burial indicate that it was expected to be the main attraction to visitors, and it is called the ""greatest display of stone age man in the world...230 skeletons left in original positions."" Views of the burial site are also featured on the two postcards. The Dickson Mounds Museum is still a branch of the Illinois State Museum, and the Dickson Mounds are now understood to be a Mississippian cemetery complex associated with nearby village sites and a ceremonial center.
